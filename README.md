## [Rock Song](Rock%20Song/)

This song started as a recorded guitar piece I made while messing around. Then I attempted to drum over by sending MIDI data to my recording software. I ran into a problem which was since I used an internal clock (no metronome) while recording the guitar it was extremely hard to record the drums live on tempo and even harder to use digital tools to alter timing and sound after recording. Even though my guitar track sounds great by itself and even has a very human feel from the change of tempo it makes sound engineering very difficult. I am currently working on an imporoved piece where I re-record the guitar with a metronome and then drum over once more.

## First Beat

This was the first sound I ever recorded and engineered. I created it after learning how to play "Hurt" by Johnny Cash. Without realizing it, I used very similair chords and plucking pattern. After realizing how un-original this really was, I decided on focusing on layering and Panning. I added a synth sound using a Launckey mini MIDI controller and used the software to send sounds from the left and right ear in order to prevent the instruments fighting for the spotlight. From this I learned that sound engineering cannot great harmony itself as the key, chords, or notes you are playing repetive to the other instrument matters a lot when dealing with clashing sounds.
