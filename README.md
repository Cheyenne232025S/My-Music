## [Rock Song](Rock%20Song/)

This song started as a recorded guitar piece I made while messing around. Then I attempted to drum over by sending MIDI data to my recording software. I ran into a problem which was since I used an internal clock (no metronome) while recording the guitar it was extremely hard to record the drums live on tempo and even harder to use digital tools to alter timing and sound after recording. Even though my guitar track sounds great by itself and has a very human feel, the non-perfect tempo compounds when I try to drum over with an even tempo. This makes it very difficult to record and to make changes afterward record since the software does not have a baseline tempo to follow. I am currently working on an imporoved piece where I re-record the guitar with a metronome and then drum over once more.

## [First Beat](First%20Beat/)

This was the first sound I ever recorded and engineered. I created it after learning how to play "Hurt" by Johnny Cash. Without realizing it, I used very similair chords and plucking pattern. After realizing how un-original this really was, I decided on focusing on layering and Panning. I added a synth sound using a Launckey mini MIDI controller and used the software to send sounds from the left and right ear in order to prevent the instruments fighting for the spotlight. From this I learned that sound engineering cannot great harmony itself as the key, chords, or notes you are playing repetive to the other instrument matters a lot when dealing with clashing sounds. 


## [Drum Beats](Drum%20Beats)

These two beats I made by using available drum kits on ableton live lite and mapping each sound to an electric drum kit. I was unable to use the sounds from the actual electric drum kit as I do not have an Audio Interface yet. For know I have been using a Multi-Effects Sound proccessor as a Audio Interface which only works for guitar. This was disapointing to find out however it turns out you can still make some really cool sounds this way. 

It has been really fun to be working with digital music making tools as I have always loved playing music and learning. It is really amazing to me how much more we can create on a single platform compared to when everything was done with hardware and analog sound affect 'machines'.
