### Rock Song
This song started as a recorded guitar piece I made while messing around. Then I attempted to drum over by sending MIDI data to my recording software. I ran into a problem which was since I used an internal clock (no metronome) while recording the guitar it was extremely hard to record the drums live on tempo and even harder to use digital tools to alter timing and sound after recording. Even though my guitar track sounds great by itself and even has a very human feel from the change of tempo it makes sound engineering very difficult. I am currently working on an imporoved piece where I re-record the guitar with a metronome and then drum over once more.
